  <summary>解题思路</summary>

*  222: Count Complete Tree Nodes
   * divide and conquer; compute number of levels for left and right (O(log n)), if left == right: left must be perfect but right might not, so recursively check right; otherwise right is perfect but left is not, so check left
   * each time we choose either left or right to calculate # of nodes => O(log n)
   * O(log n * log n) time total

    - 找最左边的node和最右边的node <br>
      - 如果depth是一样的 -> balanced / perfect binary tree <br>
      - 如果depth是不一样的 -> return 1 + self.countNodes(root.left) + self.countNodes(root.right) <br>
  
  ```
class Solution:
    def countNodes(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:    
        
        if not root: return 0
        
        def depthLeft(node):
            if not node: return 0
            return depthLeft(node.left) + 1

        def depthRight(node):
            if not node: return 0
            return depthRight(node.right) + 1
        
        l = depthLeft(root.left)
        r = depthRight(root.right)
        
        # Check if it's a balanced binary tree
        if l == r:
            return 2**(l+ 1) - 1        
        else:
            return 1 + self.countNodes(root.left) + self.countNodes(root.right)
  ```
  ```
Compare the depth between left sub tree and right sub tree.
A, If it is equal, it means the left sub tree is a full binary tree
B, It it is not , it means the right sub tree is a full binary tree
  
class Solution:
    def countNodes(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        
        if not root: return 0
        
        leftDepth = self.getDepth(root.left)
        rightDepth = self.getDepth(root.right)
        
        if leftDepth == rightDepth:
            return 2 ** leftDepth + self.countNodes(root.right)
        else:
            return 2 ** rightDepth + self.countNodes(root.left)
    
    def getDepth(self, root):
        if not root:return 0
        return 1 + self.getDepth(root.left)
  
  ```

总结：
- Complete vs perfect binary trees: <br>
**Full Binary Tree**: A Binary Tree is full if every node has 0 or 2 children. Following are examples of a full binary tree.
```
         18
       /    \   
     15      20    
    /  \       
   40   50   
  /  \
 30  50
 ```
**Complete Binary Tree**: A Binary Tree is complete Binary Tree if all levels are completely filled except possibly the last level and the last level has all keys as left as possible.
```
            18
       /         \  
     15           30  
    /  \         /  \
  40    50     100   40
 /  \   /
8   7  9 
```
**Perfect Binary Tree**: A Binary tree is Perfect Binary Tree in which all internal nodes have two children and all leaves are at same level.
```
           18
       /       \  
     15         30  
    /  \        /  \
  40    50    100   40
```
